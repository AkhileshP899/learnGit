ACCOUNTADMIN role cannot view the results for a query run by another user. (True/ False)

FALSE
Correct answer
TRUE
Overall explanation
A user cannot view the result set from a query that another user executed. This behavior is intentional. For security reasons, only the user who executed a query can access the query results. This behavior is not connected to the Snowflake access control model for objects. Even a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role cannot view the results for a query run by another user.

What would happen if we suspend the warehouse while it is executing the SQL statement?
All compute resources of the warehouse will be up until the statement is complete.
When trying to suspend the warehouse, we will get an error while the same warehouse is executing SQL statements.
Correct answer
Only idle compute resources of the warehouse will be shut down, allowing any compute resources executing statements to continue until the statement is complete.
All the compute resources of the warehouse will be shut down immediately, and the running statement will be canceled.
Overall explanation
When we suspend a warehouse, Snowflake immediately shuts down all idle compute resources for the warehouse. However, it allows any compute resources executing statements to continue until the statements are complete. At this time, the resources are shut down, and the warehouse status changes to “Suspended”. Compute resources waiting to shut down are considered to be in “quiesce” mode.

You have a dashboard that connects to Snowflake via JDBC. The dashboard is refreshed hundreds of times per day. The data is very stable, only changing once or twice per day. The query run by the dashboard user never changes. How will Snowflake manage changing and non-changing data? Mark all true statements.
Correct selection
  Snowflake will re-use data from the Results Cache as long as it is still the most up-to-date data available.  

Correct selection
Snowflake will spin up a warehouse only if the underlying data has changed.

Correct selection
Snowflake will show the most up-to-date data each time the dashboard is refreshed.
Snowflake will compile result cache data from all user results, so no warehouse is needed.

Overall explanation
Until data has not changed and the query is the same - Snowflake reuses the data from the cache. Please note,  Each time the persisted result for a query is reused, Snowflake resets the 24-hour retention period for the result up to a maximum of 31 days from the date and time that the query was first executed. After 31 days, the result is purged, and the next time the query is submitted, a new result is generated and persisted.

Overall explanation
A user's default role is the role a user gets set to each time the user logs in to Snowflake. Snowflake uses roles to control the objects (virtual warehouses, databases, tables, etc.) that users can access: 

Snowflake provides a set of predefined roles, as well as a framework for defining a hierarchy of custom roles.      All Snowflake users are automatically assigned the predefined PUBLIC role, which enables login to Snowflake and basic object access.     

In addition to the PUBLIC role, each user can be assigned additional roles, with one of these roles designated as their default role. A user’s default role determines the role used in the Snowflake sessions initiated by the user; however, this is only a default. Users can change roles within a session at any time.

What is the best way to analyze the optimum warehouse size?
Execute queries of widely-varying size and/or complexity on the same warehouse
Correct answer
Execute relatively homogeneous queries (size, complexity, data sets, etc.) on the same warehouse
Overall explanation
To achieve the best results, try to execute relatively homogeneous queries (size, complexity, data sets, etc.) on the same warehouse; executing queries of widely-varying size and/or complexity on the same warehouse makes it more difficult to analyze warehouse load, which can make it more difficult to select the best size to match the size, composition, and number of queries in your workload.

David ran a query that took around 30 mins to complete. He referred to the Query profiler and found the 'Bytes spilled to local storage' has a big number. What could be the issue?
Correct answer
David is using a comparatively smaller warehouse.
David is using a comparatively larger warehouse.
Warehouse size has no impact on Bytes spilling.
David should contact Snowflake Personnel.
Overall explanation
If a node has insufficient memory to complete its portion of a query, it will "spill" to local SSD storage. This can negatively impact performance but is sometimes acceptable. If a node has insufficient local SSD storage to complete its portion of a query, it will "spill" to remote cloud storage. This is almost always very bad for performance. The solution, in either case, is to simplify the SQL query or increase the warehouse size.

Minimum Clusters = 1 and Maximum Clusters = 1

Correct answer
Minimum Clusters = 6 and Maximum Clusters = 6
Minimum Clusters = 1 and Maximum Clusters = 10
Overall explanation
Maximized mode is enabled by specifying the same value for both maximum and minimum number of clusters (note that the specified value must be larger than 1). In this mode, when the warehouse is started, Snowflake starts all the clusters so that maximum resources are available while the warehouse is running. This mode is effective for statically controlling the available compute resources, particularly if you have large numbers of concurrent user sessions and/or queries and the numbers do not fluctuate significantly.

Increasing the number of parallel queries running in the warehouse
Correct selection
Using a larger warehouse (effectively increasing the available memory/local disk space for the operation)
Processing data in larger batches
Correct selection
Processing data in smaller batches
Correct selection
Trying to split the processing into several steps
Overall explanation
When Snowflake warehouse cannot fit an operation in memory, it starts spilling (storing) data first to the local disk of a warehouse node and then to remote storage. In such a case, Snowflake first tries to temporarily store the data on the warehouse's local disk. As this means extra IO operations, any query that requires spilling will take longer than a similar query running on similar data that is capable to fit the operations in memory. Also, if the local disk is insufficient to fit the spilled data, Snowflake further tries to write to the remote cloud storage, which will be shown in the query profile as "Bytes spilled to remote storage". 

The spilling can't always be avoided, especially for large batches of data, but it can be decreased by: 

Reducing the amount of data processed. For example, by trying to improve partition pruning or projecting only the columns that are needed in the output.

Decreasing the number of parallel queries running in the warehouse.

Trying to split the processing into several steps (for example, by replacing the CTEs with temporary tables).

Using a larger warehouse - effectively means more memory and more local disk space.
