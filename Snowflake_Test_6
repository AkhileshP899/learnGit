Question 1
Skipped
Snowflake allows which two of the following approaches for loading data?
Correct selection
Continuous Data Loading
Correct selection
Bulk Data Loading
Intermittent Data Loading
Overall explanation
Snowflake supports data loading in two primary ways. The COPY command can be used to load bulk data or huge files. To load data into a table, the COPY command requires the usage of a virtual warehouse. The other method of loading data into Snowflake is via the Snowpipe. Snowpipe is the ideal technique for loading data when the data is arriving continuously in a messaging or streaming manner. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-overview#bulk-vs-continuous-loading

Which of the following statement regarding Tasks in Snowflake is correct? Select all that apply.

Correct selection
A task can be manually executed using an EXECUTE TASK command.

Explanation
Using the EXECUTE TASK command it is possible to manually trigger an asynchronous single run of a job, which can be either a standalone task or the root task in a task graph. This run is independent of the scheduled executions defined for the task.
For more information, see the following link: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/execute-task

A single task permits a user to run multiple SQL statements on a predefined schedule.

Explanation
Each task in Snowflake is limited to executing a single SQL command or statement. It cannot execute multiple SQL statements within the same task definition.

Correct selection
A task enables users to run a single SQL command or statement on a defined schedule.

Explanation
Snowflake tasks are designed to execute single SQL commands or statements on a predefined schedule. Tasks are used to automate the execution of individual SQL commands or statements at specified intervals. They can also use procedural logic using stored procedures or Snowflake Scripting.
For more information, see the following link:
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-task#required-parameters

Which of the following aspects should you consider when defining a clustering key for a large table?
Correct selection
Cluster columns that are used frequently in WHERE clauses
Cluster all character columns
Cluster all numeric columns
Correct selection
Cluster columns that are frequently used in join statements
Overall explanation
When defining clustering keys, the initial candidate clustering columns are those columns that are frequently used in the WHERE clause or other selective filters. Additionally, columns that are used for joining can also be considered. Furthermore, the columns' cardinality (number of distinct values) is also important. It is crucial to choose a column with a high enough cardinality to allow effective partition pruning while having a low enough cardinality for Snowflake to group data into micro-partitions efficiently. A column with too few distinct values (e.g., gender) will result in minimal partition pruning. On the other hand, a column that has too many distinct values (e.g., customer id) will result in too much overhead when maintaining the partitions. When creating a multi-column cluster key, order the columns from the lowest cardinality to the higher cardinality; otherwise, the effectiveness of clustering will be reduced. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-clustering-keys

Question 54
Skipped
Which of the following best describes “Bytes spilled to local storage” shown in a query profile?
“Bytes spilled to local storage” is the number of micro-partitions pruned during query execution.
Correct answer
“Bytes spilled to local storage” indicates the volume of data that couldn’t fit in memory and had to be spilled to a virtual warehouse temporary storage.
“Bytes spilled to local storage” indicates the amount of data downloaded using the GET command.
“Bytes spilled to local storage” indicates the amount of data downloaded using Snowsight.
Overall explanation
Snowflake saves data on the warehouse's local disk if it can't fit an operation into memory. Data spilling slows down queries because it requires more IO operations, and disk access is slower than memory access. "Bytes spilled to local storage." indicates local spillage. Snowflake will spill data to remote cloud storage if the local disk becomes full, which is even slower storage than the local disk, making this operation even slower. "Bytes spilled to remote storage" in the query profile indicates remote spillage. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-query-profile#queries-too-large-to-fit-in-memory

SELECT LAST_QUERY_ID(1);

Correct selection
SELECT LAST_QUERY_ID();

Correct selection
SELECT LAST_QUERY_ID(-1);

SELECT LAST_QUERY_ID(2);

Overall explanation
The LAST_QUERY_ID function returns the query ID of a specified query in the current session. The function takes a number as the parameter, which specifies the position of the query in the session.

The parameter can take positive or negative values. A negative value means you are attempting to fetch the most recent query in the session, where

-1 = most recent query

-2 = 2nd most recent query

, and so on. The function defaults to -1, so if no value is provided, it will return the query id of the most recent query.

A positive number returns the earliest queries in the session. i.e.

1 = first query

2 = 2nd query

Suppose a multi-cluster virtual warehouse is configured with a minimum cluster count of 1 and maximum cluster count of 3. Is the virtual warehouse in Maximized mode?
Correct answer
No
Yes
Overall explanation
A multi-cluster virtual warehouse can be created in maximized or auto-scaling modes. The maximized mode is enabled by setting the minimum and maximum warehouse count of the multi-cluster to the same value. Therefore, as soon as the multi-cluster virtual warehouse is established, all warehouses in the multi-cluster are started up. Auto-Scaling mode is enabled by selecting different values for the multi-minimum clusters and maximum warehouse count.

Overall explanation
A materialized view is a view that pre-computes data based on a SELECT query. The query's results are pre-computed and physically stored to enhance performance for similar queries that are executed in the future. When the underlying table is updated, the materialized view refreshes automatically, requiring no additional maintenance.

Question 74

A user ran a complex query that took 2 hours to complete on a medium size virtual warehouse. The user re-ran the query 6 hours later in a new session. The query returned results almost immediately. What is the reason for this quick execution?
The results were retrieved from the browser cache.
Correct answer
The results were returned immediately by using the query result cache.
Data in the underlying tables has been deleted. The query ran fast because it had nothing to process.
The results were retrieved from the user stage; therefore, the execution was fast.
Overall explanation
When Snowflake runs a query, it caches the results of that query for a predetermined amount of time. The stored query results are referred to as the Query Result Cache. The Query Result Cache can be used to fulfill future queries if they are similar to a previously executed query & there have been no changes to the data in the tables being queried. When Snowflake returns query results using a query result cache, the procedure is exceptionally quick since it does not include the actual execution of the query. Because the query is not being executed, there is no need for any virtual warehouses, reducing computing costs. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/querying-persisted-results

Select all that apply.

Correct selection
A small maintenance cost is charged for the refresh operation.

An additional cost is charged for the event notifications.

The event notifications are free.

Overall explanation
A small maintenance cost is charged for refreshing a directory table's metadata, whether through notifications or manually (through ALTER STAGE <stage-name> REFRESH). This small maintenance cost is accounted for under the cloud services costs.



Additionally, when using cloud platform notifications, an additional cost is charged, which appears as Snowpipe charges in your billing statement. The Snowpipe cost is charged because Snowpipe is used for event notifications to trigger the automatic refresh.

How does defining a clustering key help with improving query performance?
Defining clustering keys results in Snowflake pre-computing query results.
Correct answer
Optimal partition pruning occurs if the queries use predicates on columns that are part of the clustering key
Snowflake distributes data on different compute clusters when clustering keys are defined
Overall explanation
Clustering a table on a specific column can optimize queries by eliminating unnecessary partitions from the query processing.

Which of the following statements regarding a Stream object in Snowflake are true? (select all that apply)

Correct selection
Materialized views do NOT support Streams.

Explanation
Streams do not support materialized view currently.

Correct selection
A stream object records DML changes (inserts, updates, and deletes) made to a table at the row level.

Explanation
Snowflake Streams help you keep track of any changes made to a table, such as new data being added (inserts), existing data being modified (updates), or data being removed (deletes). They allow you to query and process only the changed data since the last offset.
See the link for more details: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-intro

A Stream object can keep track of DML changes for a table for several years.

Explanation
A Stream object monitors and records the DML changes to a source table within the specified data retention period. After that, the stream becomes stale, and the DML changes are not available. Snowflake extends table data retention to prevent stale streams up to the maximum defined extension defaulting to 14 and maximum up to 90.

See the following links for more details: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-intro#data-retention-period-and-staleness and https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/parameters#max-data-extension-time-in-days

External tables do NOT support Streams.

Explanation
Streams support external tables. Insert-only streams in Snowflake track changes to external tables by capturing both inserts and updates as new rows, but they ignore delete operations. This means they only reflect additions and modifications to data, treating updates as new inserts.

Overall explanation
When a directory table is queried, the result set contains the FILE_URL for each file in the stage object. The result set also contains additional metadata, such as the file's relative path, which shows the file's path relative to the stage. The result set also has metadata such as the size of the file in bytes and the timestamp of when a file was last modified, the MD5 checksum for the file, and an ETAG file, which changes if the contents of the file change. When querying a directory table, you can filter the result set using the WHERE clause on any of these fields. For example, you can use the size column to limit your results to only those files that are greater than 10MB.

True or False: When a Snowflake data provider shares data with a data consumer, the data consumer is not charged for any additional storage costs.
False
Correct answer
True
Overall explanation
Metadata operations in the cloud services layer allow data sharing without physically copying it. Since the provider account stores and pays for the data storage, the data consumer doesn't have to pay anything extra for storage. However, the data consumer pays for the compute used to run queries on shared data. When queries are run on shared data, the compute of the data consumer is used. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro#how-does-secure-data-sharing-work

Which of the following statements regarding multi-cluster virtual warehouses are true? Select all that apply.
Correct selection
Multi-cluster virtual warehouses automatically add additional clusters when simultaneous queries increase to a number that existing virtual warehouses can not handle.
Multi-cluster virtual warehouses cannot be set to auto-suspend or auto-resume.
Correct selection
A minimum of Enterprise edition is required for multi-cluster virtual warehouse capability.
Correct selection
Multi-cluster virtual warehouses automatically remove additional clusters when query demand decreases.
Overall explanation
Multi-cluster virtual warehouses are utilized when the number of concurrent users exceeds a single virtual warehouse's capacity. When the concurrent workload for a virtual warehouse reaches the maximum, new queries are queued. Multi-cluster virtual warehouses address this by adding clusters as needed. When the demand drops, the extra clusters are removed. Enterprise edition is required to use the multi-cluster virtual warehouse feature. Besides the automatic addition and removal of compute clusters, multi-cluster virtual warehouses behave the same as typical virtual warehouses so that they can be suspended or resumed and auto-suspended or auto-resumed. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-multicluster

Which of the following sentences accurately describes scaling out in Snowflake? Choose all that apply.
Correct selection
Scaling out is accomplished through the usage of multi-cluster virtual warehouses.
Correct selection
Scaling out can assist in reducing query queuing.
Scaling out is accomplished by increasing or decreasing the size of a virtual warehouse.
Overall explanation
Typically, a virtual warehouse has a defined set of computing resources that it can use to execute queries. When queries are sent to a warehouse, the warehouse allocates the resources required for each query and begins running the queries. If there aren't enough resources to run all the queries sent to the warehouse, Snowflake queues the extra queries until the resources are available again. Snowflake provides multi-cluster virtual warehouses to overcome this issue. Multi-cluster virtual warehouses are frequently used in scenarios where the number of concurrent queries exceeds the capacity of a single virtual warehouse. When a virtual warehouse's concurrent workload exceeds its maximum capacity, additional queries are placed in the queue. Multi-cluster virtual warehouses dynamically add additional clusters based on demand to solve the queueing issue. When demand decreases, the additional clusters are decommissioned. This process is also known as scaling out or auto-scaling.

In Snowflake, which of the following can be used to load continuously arriving data?
Correct answer
Snowpipe
SnowStorm
SnowFast
SnowTrickle
Overall explanation
Snowflake allows continuous data loading using Snowpipe, a serverless service. Snowpipe enables you to load data in a micro-batch manner, loading small volumes of data on each execution. The micro-batch-based data loading is used when a continuous stream of data, such as transactions or events, must be loaded and made available to enterprises quickly. Snowpipe enables continuous data loading and can load data within a few minutes after it arrives in a stage. Snowpipe is serverless and has its own computational capability; therefore, it does not rely on virtual warehouses for processing. Snowflake automatically manages the compute required by a Snowpipe. Snowflake also manages the scaling up and down of a Snowpipe as per the data load requirement. Since a Snowpipe is serverless, its costs are charged separately from virtual warehousing fees. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-intro

Question 114
Skipped
True or False: You can increase or decrease the size of a virtual warehouse as required.
False
Correct answer
True
Overall explanation
A virtual warehouse can be scaled up to ensure satisfactory performance when the complexity of the queries has increased. Scaling up allows the virtual warehouse to expand in size to keep up with the increasing complexity of the tasks. When a virtual warehouse is scaled up, the number of nodes in the compute cluster increases. Scaling down a virtual warehouse is generally done in response to decreased query complexity, where a smaller virtual warehouse may be sufficient to meet the performance requirements. When a virtual warehouse is scaled down, nodes are removed from the virtual warehouse. https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/warehouses-considerations

Snowflake offers an alternative approach for tables called external tables, which permits the creation of tables with data stored in external cloud storage. External tables remove the need for the data to be loaded into Snowflake. In the case of an External table, the definition of the table is still stored in Snowflake metadata and consists of table structure, file locations, filenames, and other attributes. However, the table's data is saved outside of Snowflake. The external table functionality enables you to query external data like a standard table.
