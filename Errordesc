# Migration of View from Oracle to Snowflake: Issue Resolution Log

## 1. **Initial Issue: Timezone Error**
- **Error Message:**
  ```
  "Timestamp 'GMT' is not recognized"
  ```
- **Description:**  
  The error occurred because Snowflake didn’t recognize `'GMT'` as a valid timezone in the `CONVERT_TIMEZONE` function.
  
- **Resolution:**  
  We replaced `'GMT'` with the valid UTC offset `'+00:00'`, which represents the same time zone. In Snowflake, explicit time zone offsets are more reliable.
  
  **Updated Query:**
  ```sql
  CONVERT_TIMEZONE('+00:00', TO_TIMESTAMP(TO_CHAR(b.startdt, 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS'), 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS'))
  ```

## 2. **Subsequent Issue: Timezone 'UTC' Error**
- **Error Message:**
  ```
  "Timestamp 'UTC' is not recognized"
  ```
- **Description:**  
  Similar to the previous issue with `'GMT'`, Snowflake did not recognize `'UTC'` in the `CONVERT_TIMEZONE` function.
  
- **Resolution:**  
  Once again, we used `'+00:00'` as the timezone offset instead of `'UTC'`.

  **Updated Query:**
  ```sql
  CONVERT_TIMEZONE('+00:00', TO_TIMESTAMP(TO_CHAR(b.startdt, 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS'), 'MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS'))
  ```

## 3. **Issue: Negative or Invalid Position Error**
- **Error Message:**
  ```
  "Invalid parameter value: -1. Reason: Position must be positive"
  ```
- **Description:**  
  This error was caused by the `REGEXP_INSTR` function when it didn't find the backslash (`\\`) pattern, returning `-1` or `0`, which caused an invalid position when passed to the `SUBSTR` function.
  
- **Resolution:**  
  To fix this, we used a `CASE` statement to check if `REGEXP_INSTR` returns a valid position (greater than `0`). If not, the original value was returned.

  **Updated Query:**
  ```sql
  CASE
      WHEN REGEXP_INSTR(b.inst_nt, '\\\\\\\\', 1, 1) > 0
      THEN SUBSTR(b.inst_nt, REGEXP_INSTR(b.inst_nt, '\\\\\\\\', 1, 1) + 1, LENGTH(b.inst_nt))
      ELSE b.inst_nt
  END AS inst_nt
  ```

## 4. **Issue: Proper Escaping of Backslashes in REGEXP_INSTR**
- **Error Message:**
  ```
  "Invalid parameter value: -1. Reason: Position must be positive"
  ```
- **Description:**  
  Even after handling the invalid position issue, the `REGEXP_INSTR` function failed to correctly process the backslashes in the pattern. Backslashes in Snowflake need to be escaped properly.
  
- **Resolution:**  
  We escaped the backslashes correctly by doubling them, ensuring that the regular expression searched for the correct literal backslash characters.

  **Final Updated Query:**
  ```sql
  CASE
      WHEN REGEXP_INSTR(b.inst_nt, '\\\\\\\\', 1, 1) > 0
      THEN SUBSTR(b.inst_nt, REGEXP_INSTR(b.inst_nt, '\\\\\\\\', 1, 1) + 1, LENGTH(b.inst_nt))
      ELSE b.inst_nt
  END AS inst_nt
  ```

---

### Summary of Fixes:
1. Replaced `'GMT'` and `'UTC'` with `'+00:00'` in `CONVERT_TIMEZONE`.
2. Added a `CASE` statement to handle the `REGEXP_INSTR` function to avoid negative or zero positions.
3. Escaped backslashes correctly in `REGEXP_INSTR` by using `\\\\\\\\` in the pattern.
