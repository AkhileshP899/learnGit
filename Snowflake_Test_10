During Warehouse provisioning, if any of the compute resources fail to provision, then Snowflake kills the entire warehouse provisioning and tries to provision a new warehouse of the same requested size. (True/False)

What is a key benefit of scaling up a warehouse?
Correct answer
Scaling up improves performance.
Scaling up improves concurrency.
Overall explanation
Resizing a warehouse generally improves query performance, particularly for larger, more complex queries. It can also help reduce the queuing that occurs if a warehouse does not have enough compute resources to process all the queries that are submitted concurrently. Note that warehouse resizing is not intended for handling concurrency issues; instead, use additional warehouses to handle the workload or use a multi-cluster warehouse.

Overall explanation
Snowflake’s architecture is a hybrid of traditional shared-disk and shared-nothing database architectures. Like shared-disk architectures, Snowflake uses a central data repository for persisted data accessible from all compute nodes in the platform. But similar to shared-nothing architectures, Snowflake processes queries using MPP (massively parallel processing) compute clusters where each node in the cluster stores a portion of the entire data set locally. This approach offers the data management simplicity of a shared-disk architecture but with the performance and scale-out benefits of a shared-nothing architecture. It is also termed as Multi-Cluster Shared Data Architecture.

David wants to load a JSON file using the COPY INTO <table> command. He found that there are null values in the data for missing values and have no other special meaning. What file format option would you recommend him to use with COPY INTO <table> command to handle the JSON null values?

David should use STRIP_OUTER_ELEMENT = FALSE
David should use REPLACE_INVALID_CHARACTERS = TRUE
Correct answer
David should use STRIP_NULL_VALUES = TRUE
David should use STRIP_NULL_VALUES = FALSE
Overall explanation
In a VARIANT column, NULL values are stored as a string containing the word “null,” not the SQL NULL value. If the “null” values in your JSON documents indicate missing values and have no other special meaning, you should recommend setting the file format option STRIP_NULL_VALUES to TRUE for the COPY INTO <table> command when loading the JSON files.

UDF runs with either the caller’s or the owner’s rights. (True / False)
TRUE
Correct answer
FALSE
Overall explanation
UDF only runs as the function owner. A stored procedure runs with either the caller’s rights or the owner’s rights. It cannot run with both at the same time. A caller’s rights stored procedure runs with the privileges of the caller. The primary advantage of a caller’s rights stored procedure is that it can access information about that caller or about the caller’s current session. For example, a caller’s rights stored procedure can read the caller’s session variables and use them in a query. 

An owner’s rights stored procedure runs mostly with the privileges of the stored procedure’s owner. The primary advantage of an owner’s rights stored procedure is that the owner can delegate specific administrative tasks, such as cleaning up old data, to another role without granting that role more general privileges, such as privileges to delete all data from a specific table. 

At the time that the stored procedure is created, the creator specifies whether the procedure runs with the owner’s rights or the caller’s rights. The default is owner’s rights.

User Stage: User stages cannot be altered or dropped. A user stage is allocated to each user for storing files. This stage type is designed to store staged and managed files by a single user but can be loaded into multiple tables.   

Table Stage: Table stages cannot be altered or dropped. A table stage is available for each table created in Snowflake. This stage type is designed to store staged and managed files by one or more users but only loaded into a single table.

Named Stage: A named internal stage is a database object created in a schema. This stage type can store files staged and managed by one or more users and loaded into one or more tables.

How can a directory table metadata be refreshed automatically and efficiently to synchronize the metadata with the latest associated files in the external stage and path?
Using both Tasks and Stream
Using Tasks
Using Stream
It is a manual process and cant be automatically refreshed
Correct answer
Using Cloud event notification service
Overall explanation
The metadata for a directory table can be refreshed automatically using the event notification service for your cloud storage service. The refresh operation synchronizes the metadata with the latest set of associated files in the external stage and path, i.e.:         

New files in the path are added to the table metadata.         

Changes to files in the path are updated in the table metadata.         

Files no longer in the path are removed from the table metadata.

Which of these configurations will set up a warehouse in maximized mode?
Minimum Clusters = 1 and Maximum Clusters = 1
Correct answer
Minimum Clusters = 6 and Maximum Clusters = 6
Minimum Clusters = 9 and Maximum Clusters = 10
Minimum Clusters = 1 and Maximum Clusters = 10
Overall explanation
Maximized mode is enabled by specifying the same value for both the maximum and a minimum number of clusters (note that the specified value must be larger than 1). In this mode, when the warehouse is started, Snowflake starts all the clusters so that maximum resources are available while the warehouse is running. This mode is effective for statically controlling the available compute resources, particularly if you have large numbers of concurrent user sessions and/or queries and the numbers do not fluctuate significantly.

How much-uncompressed data does a micro-partition contain in Snowflake?

Between 1 GB to 10 GB
Between 5 MB to 50 MB
Between 1 MB to 100 MB
Correct answer
Between 50 MB to 500 MB
Overall explanation
Each micro-partition contains between 50 MB and 500 MB of uncompressed data (Note that the actual size in Snowflake is smaller because data is always stored compressed.). Groups of rows in tables are mapped into individual micro-partitions, organized in a columnar fashion. This size is between 50 MB and 500 MB, and the structure allows for extremely granular pruning of very large tables, which can be comprised of millions, or even hundreds of millions, of micro-partitions. It enables extremely efficient DML and fine-grained pruning for faster queries.

The OUTER => FALSE argument with FLATTEN omits the output of the input rows that cannot be expanded, either because they cannot be accessed in the path or because they have zero fields or entries.

A stored procedure can run both the caller’s and the owner’s rights simultaneously. (TRUE / FALSE)
Correct answer
FALSE
TRUE
Overall explanation
A stored procedure runs with either the caller’s rights or the owner’s rights. It cannot run with both at the same time. A caller’s rights stored procedure runs with the privileges of the caller. The primary advantage of a caller’s rights stored procedure is that it can access information about that caller or about the caller’s current session. For example, a caller’s rights stored procedure can read the caller’s session variables and use them in a query. An owner’s rights stored procedure runs mostly with the privileges of the stored procedure’s owner. The primary advantage of an owner’s rights stored procedure is that the owner can delegate specific administrative tasks, such as cleaning up old data, to another role without granting that role more general privileges, such as privileges to delete all data from a specific table. At the time that the stored procedure is created, the creator specifies whether the procedure runs with owner’s rights or caller’s rights. The default is owner’s rights.
