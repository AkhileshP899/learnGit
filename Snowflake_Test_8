Question 1
Skipped
A stored procedure can run both the caller’s and the owner’s rights simultaneously. (TRUE / FALSE)
Correct answer
FALSE
TRUE
Overall explanation
A stored procedure runs with either the caller’s rights or the owner’s rights. It cannot run with both at the same time. A caller’s rights stored procedure runs with the privileges of the caller. The primary advantage of a caller’s rights stored procedure is that it can access information about that caller or about the caller’s current session. For example, a caller’s rights stored procedure can read the caller’s session variables and use them in a query. An owner’s rights stored procedure runs mostly with the privileges of the stored procedure’s owner. The primary advantage of an owner’s rights stored procedure is that the owner can delegate specific administrative tasks, such as cleaning up old data, to another role without granting that role more general privileges, such as privileges to delete all data from a specific table. At the time that the stored procedure is created, the creator specifies whether the procedure runs with owner’s rights or caller’s rights. The default is owner’s rights.

David wants to load a JSON file using the COPY INTO <table> command. He found that there are null values in the data for missing values and have no other special meaning. What file format option would you recommend him to use with COPY INTO <table> command to handle the JSON null values?
David should use STRIP_OUTER_ELEMENT = FALSE
David should use REPLACE_INVALID_CHARACTERS = TRUE
David should use STRIP_OUTER_ELEMENT = TRUE
Correct answer
David should use STRIP_NULL_VALUES = TRUE
David should use STRIP_NULL_VALUES = FALSE
Overall explanation
In a VARIANT column, NULL values are stored as a string containing the word “null,” not the SQL NULL value. If the “null” values in your JSON documents indicate missing values and have no other special meaning, you should recommend setting the file format option STRIP_NULL_VALUES to TRUE for the COPY INTO <table> command when loading the JSON files. Retaining the “null” values often wastes storage and slows query processing.

What are the possible values for the VALIDATION_MODE option in the COPY INTO <table> statement?

RETURN_ROWS

Correct selection
RETURN_ERRORS

Correct selection
RETURN_<n>_ROWS

Correct selection
RETURN_ALL_ERRORS

Overall explanation
The VALIDATION_MODE parameter in the COPY INTO <table> command instructs the command to validate the data files instead of loading them into the specified table. This means the COPY command will test the files for errors, but not actually load them. The command will validate the data based on the specified validation option:

RETURN_<n>_ROWS (e.g. RETURN_10_ROWS): Validates the specified number of rows and fails at the first error encountered if any, otherwise the validation continues without error.

RETURN_ERRORS: Returns all errors across all specified files, including parsing and conversion errors.

RETURN_ALL_ERRORS: Returns all errors across all specified files, including errors that were partially loaded during a previous load with the ON_ERROR option set to CONTINUE.


The syntax for the VALIDATION_MODE parameter is: VALIDATION_MODE = RETURN_<n>_ROWS | RETURN_ERRORS | RETURN_ALL_ERRORS.

It is important to note that the option RETURN_ROWS can only be used with the COPY INTO <location> command and not with COPY INTO <table>. This option is the only one available for the VALIDATION_MODE in COPY INTO <location>.

How can we add a Directory table explicitly to a stage to store a catalog of staged files?
Using CREATE DIRECTORY TABLE command and then add to the stage by ALTER STAGE command
Using CREATE DIRECTORY TABLES command and then add to the stage by ALTER STAGE command
Correct answer
Using CREATE STAGE command
Overall explanation
A Directory table is not a separate database object; it stores a catalog of staged files in cloud storage. Roles with sufficient privileges can query a directory table to retrieve file URLs to access the staged files and other metadata. A directory table can be added explicitly to a stage when the stage is created (using CREATE STAGE) or later (using ALTER STAGE) with supplying directoryTableParams. directoryTableParams (for internal stages) ::= [ DIRECTORY = ( ENABLE = { TRUE | FALSE } [ REFRESH_ON_CREATE = { TRUE | FALSE } ] ) ] ENABLE = TRUE | FALSE Specifies whether to add a directory table to the stage.

Correct answer
VALIDATION_MODE is used to validate the load file for errors instead of loading it into the specified table.
VALIDATION_MODE is used to validate the load file and load it into the specified table if there is no error.
Overall explanation
VALIDATION_MODE instructs the COPY command to validate the data files instead of loading them into the specified table; i.e., the COPY command tests the files for errors but does not load them. The command validates the data to be loaded and returns results based on the validation option specified: Syntax : VALIDATION_MODE = RETURN_n_ROWS | RETURN_ERRORS | RETURN_ALL_ERRORS RETURN_n_ROWS (e.g. RETURN_10_ROWS) - Validates the specified number of rows, if no errors are encountered; otherwise, fails at the first error encountered in the rows. RETURN_ERRORS - Returns all errors (parsing, conversion, etc.) across all files specified in the COPY statement.

Which is the fastest option for selecting staged data files to load from a stage?
By path (internal stages) / prefix (Amazon S3 bucket)
Correct answer
Specifying a list of specific files to load
Using pattern matching to identify specific files by pattern
Overall explanation
Of the three options for identifying/specifying data files to load from a stage, providing a discrete list of files is generally the fastest; however, the FILES parameter supports a maximum of 1,000 files, meaning a COPY command executed with the FILES parameter can only load up to 1,000 files. Example: copy into load1 from @%load1/data1/ files=('test1.csv', 'test2.csv', 'test3.csv', 'test4.csv')

Select the type of function that returns one value per group of rows (for example - AVG, MAX, MIN)
Table Function
Window Function
Correct answer
Aggregate Function
User-Defined Function
System Function
Scalar Function
Overall explanation
Aggregate functions operate on values across rows to perform mathematical calculations such as sum, average, counting, minimum/maximum values, standard deviation, and estimation, as well as some non-mathematical operations. An aggregate function takes multiple rows (actually, zero, one, or more rows) as input and produces a single output. In contrast, scalar functions take one row as input and produce one row (one value) as output. An aggregate function always returns exactly one row, even when the input contains zero rows. Typically, if the input contained zero rows, the output is NULL. However, an aggregate function could return 0, an empty string, or some other value when passed zero rows.
